## DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

Objective:
The Smart Light Control system is designed to enable remote control of lighting via a smartphone or web application. The system integrates a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266, or ESP32) with IoT platforms such as Blynk, MQTT, or Firebase to allow users to turn lights on/off, adjust brightness, and possibly change color (if RGB lights are used).

Key Features:
1.Remote Control: Users can turn lights on/off from anywhere using a smartphone app or web interface.
2.Dimming Functionality: Adjustable brightness levels (if using dimmable LEDs).
3.Color Control: If using RGB LEDs, users can select colors from the app.
4.Automation & Scheduling: Users can set schedules for automatic lighting control.
5.Voice Control (Optional): Integration with Google Assistant, Alexa, or Siri for voice commands.
6.Sensor-Based Automation: Lights can turn on/off automatically based on motion detection or ambient light sensors.

Components Required:
Microcontroller: ESP8266, ESP32, or Arduino with a Wi-Fi module
Relay Module: For switching lights on/off
LEDs or Bulbs: Dimmable or RGB LED lights
Power Supply: Appropriate power source (e.g., 5V for microcontrollers, 220V for AC lights)
IoT Platform: Blynk, MQTT, or Firebase for remote access
Sensors (Optional): Motion sensors (PIR), LDR for ambient light sensing

Working Principle:
1.The microcontroller connects to the internet via Wi-Fi.
2.Users interact with a smartphone app or web dashboard to send control signals.
3.The microcontroller receives commands and controls the lights accordingly.
4.Sensors (if used) automate lighting based on movement or ambient conditions.
